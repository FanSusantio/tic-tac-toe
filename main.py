############### Our TicTacToe Rules #####################
# The gameplay will be as follows.

# First, one user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
# Next, the second user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
# The goal of the players is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise, or diagonally.
# The game goes on until a player wins the game or it ended up in a draw by filling all boxes without a winning match.

#TODO-1 Create a board using a 2-dimensional array and initialize each element as empty.

#TODO-2 Write a function to check whether the board is filled or not.

#TODO-3 Write a function to check whether a player has won or not.

#TODO-4 Write a function to show the board as we will show the board multiple times to the users while they are playing.

#TODO-5 Write a function to start the game.

#Select the first turn of the player randomly.
#Write an infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
#Show the board to the user to select the spot for the next move.
#Ask the user to enter the row and column number.
#Update the spot with the respective player sign.
#Check whether the current player won the game or not.
#If the current player won the game, then print a winning message and break the infinite loop.
#Next, check whether the board is filled or not.
#If the board is filled, then print the draw message and break the infinite loop.
#Finally, show the user the final view of the board.

#Select one or two player game
