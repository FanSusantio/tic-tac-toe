############### TicTacToe Project #####################

############### Our TicTacToe Rules #####################
# The gameplay will be as follows.

# First, one user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
# Next, the second user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
# The goal of the players is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise, or diagonally.
# The game goes on until a player wins the game or it ended up in a draw by filling all boxes without a winning match.

# How does the game work?
# The board is numbered like the keyboardâ€™s number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.
#  7 | 8 | 9
# ---+---+---
#  4 | 5 | 6
# ---+---+---
#  1 | 2 | 3
