## Assignment: Tic Tac Toe
Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.

### Concepts revised:

There were two examples of code which I used as a starting point before making additions
- https://geekflare.com/tic-tac-toe-python-code/
- https://medium.com/byte-tales/the-classic-tic-tac-toe-game-in-python-3-1427c68b8874

### Future development
* incorporate a logo banner

# How does the game work?
The board is numbered like the keyboardâ€™s number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.
